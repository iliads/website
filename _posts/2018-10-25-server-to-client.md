title: Server to Client
description: Kicking off the first instalment in our 'From URL to Interactive' series, Ali Alabbas takes us through the journey of how our code makes it to the browser. In 'Server to Client', he discusses how server connections are made, caching, and how service workers factor into the request and response process. You don't want to miss this master class from a networking expert; grasping this aspect of how things run under the browser hood is essential to understanding performance.
