title: The Psychology of Design
description: As humans, we have an underlying 'blueprint' for how we perceive and process the world around us, and the study of psychology helps us define this blueprint. And as designers, we can leverage psychology principles to build more intuitive products. But where to start? Author Jon Yablonski explains three essential theories of psychology, and provides real-world examples of how they can be used to benefit design. He also discusses the ethical implications of leveraging psychology in design, and what we should all keep in mind if we want to be ethical design citizens.
