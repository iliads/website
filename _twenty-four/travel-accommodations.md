## Getting to Emory

Driving directions and campus maps can be found on the [Emory Directions webpage](https://apply.emory.edu/discover/visit/directions.html). 

[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport](https://www.atl.com/) is a 30-45 minute trip by car, depending on traffic. Ride-shares and taxis are available. [MARTA](http://www.itsmarta.com/), Atlanta’s mass transit system, provides train service from the airport to stations near Emory.

ILiADS participants should plan to arrive at Emory on Sunday, July 14; carpooling and ride-shares from the airport can be coordinated with other participants via the ILiADS Slack. If participants have specific accessibility needs, please contact the ILiADS Steering Committee to discuss available accommodations. The Institute will wrap up after lunch on Friday, July 19.

Parking passes will be available to participants who need to park a personal or rental vehicle on campus.

## Food Options

ILiADS registration includes breakfast and lunch the week of the Institute (Monday through Friday), as well as two catered group dinners on Sunday and Wednesday. Dinners on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday are not included and provide an opportunity for participants to explore the Emory area or Atlanta (for the adventurous!).

Nearby [Emory Village](https://www.theinfatuation.com/atlanta/guides/where-to-eat-and-drink-in-emory-village) has various local restaurants and some fast food joints. Somewhat further away, Emory Point features [The General Muir](https://www.thegeneralmuir.com/emorypoint) (a great deli/restaurant), [Gymnasium Brewery](https://www.schoolhousebeer.com/gymnasium/), [Srithai Thai Kitchen](http://www.srithaikitchen.com/), and [Boru Boru Sushi](https://boruboru.com/). Additional information on local dining options will be provided to participants at registration.

## Housing Options

Campus dormitory housing is available for ILiADS participants, with check-in on Sunday, July 14, and check-out on Friday, July 19. On-campus dormitory housing for ILiADS participants amounts to $205 for the week. Dormitory housing is single-occupant rooms with shared lavatories (some single lavatories in the building), shower rooms, lounges, and kitchens. Dormitory floors will be gender-specific. Dorms are accessible, air-conditioned, and include linens.

Dormitory housing will be in [The Complex](https://conferences.emory.edu/housing/halls.html) which consists of three buildings, Hopkins, Smith, and Thomas Halls, that are joined together by study rooms and lounges. Each of the buildings’ rooms and amenities are similar, and share some communal areas (such as the large multi-purpose room or kitchen). The Complex is conveniently located across the street from Goizueta Business School, Woodruff Library, and only a short distance from the Schwartz Center, Emory University Hospital, and Cox Hall.

If you wish to make your own accommodation arrangements at your own cost, the following options are convenient to campus:

* [Emory University Conference Center](https://www.emoryconferencecenter.com/)
* [The University Inn at Emory](https://www.univinn.com/)
