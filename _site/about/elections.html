    <h1 class="fancy text-center">Elections</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>The ILiADS Steering Committee is made up of nine positions, eight elected and one appointed. Terms are staggered, so that each year four positions will be open for elections.</p>

<p>Anyone who has attended an ILiADS is welcome to nominate or be nominated for any open position. Self nominations are also always welcome. Each year the slate will be vetted by the current Steering Committee to confirm eligibility, and nominees will be contacted to confirm their desire to stand for election and asked to write a short statement about why they would like to serve in each position they would like to stand for.</p>

<p>Nominees may choose to stand for election in up to two contests. If elected to two positions, the nominee must choose which of the two positions they would like to hold. (The other election’s runner-up will then be offered the position.) Votes for ILiADS elections are tabulated using <a href="https://www.fairvote.org/rcv#where_is_ranked_choice_voting_used">ranked choice voting</a>.</p>

<p>Both the nomination form and the ballot will be distributed via the ILiADS mailing list. Join the mailing list or make sure your information is up to date by visiting the <a href="https://iliads.org/mailman/listinfo/iliads_iliads.org">ILiADS Mailing List Dashboard</a>.</p>
