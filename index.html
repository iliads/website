<h1 class="fancy">What is ILiADS?</h1>
<p class="fancy-p">ILiADS is a week-long summer institute where participants develop digital projects in teams of faculty, students, librarians, and technologists. During this week of immersion, teams build upon established digital pedagogy or scholarship projects and/or launch new ones. Teams have access to our pool of ILiADS liaisons who provide training and guidance on digital scholarship technologies and methods. </p>
