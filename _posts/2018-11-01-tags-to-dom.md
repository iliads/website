title: Tags to DOM
description: In the second installment of A List Apart's four-part 'From URL to Interactive' series, Travis Leithead, former editor of W3C's HTML spec, walks us through the process of parsing HTML - from how browsers create trees to how the DOM responds to events. Equipped with this knowledge, you'll be able to make smarter DOM decisions, reduce time to interactive, and eliminate unintended reflows.
