    <hr />
    <p><strong>Deadline: March 15, 2024 (extended to March 29!)</strong></p>

<p>The ILiADS Steering Committee welcomes proposals for the seventh annual Institute for Liberal Arts Digital Scholarship! This year’s Institute, hosted by Pitts Theology Library at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, will be held in person July 14-19, 2024.</p>

<p>ILiADS offers a week-long intensive environment for collaborative project teams composed of some mix of researchers, librarians, technologists, and students to build upon established digital pedagogy or scholarship projects and/or launch new ones. To help get a new project started and/or clear hurdles, each team is assigned a Liaison expert to consult on the project and help connect them to other experts. The schedule for the week includes focused team time supplemented by panels and talks designed around the cohort. This allows time for hands-on exploration and open inquiry and allows for the community to drive professional development throughout the week through responsive pop-up sessions and spontaneous collaborations. Over the course of the week, team members will learn more about their own collaboration and how to sustain their project into the future.</p>

<p>Registration costs for this year’s Institute are not yet finalized, but applicants are encouraged to review general information about the cost and logistics typically associated with a team’s participation.</p>

<p>The steering committee encourages proposals from teams in whole or in part new to digital scholarship. We employ an expansive definition of “digital project” that can include topics like infrastructure development and pedagogical practice. Projects of all types, and in any stage, are welcomed. We invite projects led by staff and early career faculty, as well as projects with substantial undergraduate leadership. We especially encourage proposals from teams that include members who are Black, Indigenous, Latinx, and people of color, people with disabilities, neurodivergent people, and LGBTQ+ people.</p>

<p><strong>Examples of successful project proposals from the past are linked below. Please send a PDF with your completed proposal to 2024@iliads.org by Friday, March 29, 2024.</strong></p>
