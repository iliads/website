## Why partner with ILiADS?

ILiADS is not only a week-long opportunity for teams to focus on a digital humanities project, it is a network of expertise, colleagues, and projects that demonstrate the scholarly and pedagogical impact of the digital liberal arts. A key element of the ILiADS model are the liaisons, who are dedicated and project specific technical leads that help enable projects to move forward, but who also network with other liaisons.

Sustaining a week long institute with a dedicated project specific liaison for each team is possible with donations from our partner institutions.
